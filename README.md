# kinectron-test

a small boilerplate for integrating the [kinectron](https://kinectron.github.io/#) framework in an electron client instead of a native HTML website.

to start the project, run `npm start`. **make sure the kinectron server app is running and body tracking has been enabled on the kinect beforehand!**
